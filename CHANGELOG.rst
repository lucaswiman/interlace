0.2.0 (unreleased)
-------------------

**Async DPOR**

``explore_async_dpor()`` brings systematic interleaving exploration to async
code.  Tasks are async callables scheduled cooperatively; ``await_point()``
marks explicit yield points where context switches can occur.  The same Rust
DPOR engine (vector clocks, conflict analysis, backtrack sets) drives the
exploration.  SQL tracking (``detect_sql=True``) reuses the existing async
cursor patching, so asyncpg, aiosqlite, and aiomysql queries are detected as
conflicts automatically.

- New module: ``frontrun.async_dpor`` (``explore_async_dpor``, ``await_point``).
- Contrib helpers merged into packages: ``frontrun.contrib.django``
  (``django_dpor``, ``async_django_dpor``) and ``frontrun.contrib.sqlalchemy``
  (``sqlalchemy_dpor``, ``async_sqlalchemy_dpor``, ``get_connection``,
  ``get_async_connection``).
- Integration tests against asyncpg, SQLAlchemy async, and Django async ORM.

**SQL conflict detection in DPOR**

DPOR now understands SQL.  Instead of treating all database traffic to the
same host:port as a single conflict point, frontrun parses each SQL statement
at the DBAPI layer, extracts per-table (or per-row) resource IDs, and reports
them with correct Read/Write access kinds.  Two threads on different tables
are independent; two SELECTs on the same table are independent; only
genuinely conflicting operations (same table/row, at least one write) trigger
interleaving exploration.

- SQL parsing via regex fast-path (~90% of ORM queries) with sqlglot
  fallback for complex SQL (CTEs, subqueries, UNION, MERGE).
- Row-level conflict detection using equality and IN-list predicates on
  primary key columns.  Parameter resolution for all five PEP 249
  paramstyles (qmark, numeric, named, format, pyformat).
- DBAPI cursor monkey-patching for sqlite3, psycopg2, psycopg3, pymysql,
  asyncpg, aiosqlite, and aiomysql.  Both sync and async drivers supported.
- Endpoint suppression prevents double-reporting when SQL-level detection is
  active, including for C-level drivers via the LD_PRELOAD bridge.
- Transaction grouping: operations within BEGIN/COMMIT are buffered and
  reported atomically.  SAVEPOINT and ROLLBACK TO handle partial rollback.
- Lock intent detection: SELECT FOR UPDATE and LOCK TABLE statements are
  classified as writes.
- PostgreSQL wire protocol parsing in the Rust LD_PRELOAD library catches
  C-level SQL from libpq (Simple Query and Extended Query messages).
- Anomaly classification: when DPOR finds a failing interleaving involving
  SQL, the anomaly is classified as lost update, write skew, dirty read,
  non-repeatable read, phantom read, or write-write conflict via DSG cycle
  analysis.
- Correctness verified by three TLA+ specifications (38,000+ states, 23
  invariants, all passing).

0.1.0 (2026-02-27)
-------------------

**DPOR (Dynamic Partial Order Reduction)**

Systematic interleaving exploration via a Rust engine (``frontrun._dpor``,
built with PyO3/maturin).  Unlike the bytecode explorer which samples random
schedules, DPOR guarantees that every meaningfully distinct interleaving is
tried exactly once.  Shared-memory conflicts are detected automatically at the
bytecode level using a shadow stack; vector clocks prune redundant orderings.

**Automatic I/O detection**

Both the bytecode explorer and DPOR now detect socket and file I/O
automatically (``detect_io=True`` by default).  When two threads touch the same
network endpoint or file path the scheduler treats the operations as
conflicting and explores their reorderings.

**C-level I/O interception**

A new ``frontrun`` CLI wraps any command with an ``LD_PRELOAD`` library
(``libfrontrun_io.so``, built from ``crates/io/``) that intercepts libc I/O
functions (``connect``, ``send``, ``recv``, ``read``, ``write``, etc.).  This
covers opaque C extensions such as database drivers, Redis clients, and HTTP
libraries.

**Interpretable error messages**

When a race condition is found, ``result.explanation`` now contains a
human-readable trace showing interleaved source lines, the conflict pattern
(lost update, write–write, etc.), and reproduction statistics.

**LD_PRELOAD events wired into DPOR**

When run under the ``frontrun`` CLI with ``detect_io=True`` (the default),
``explore_dpor()`` now consumes C-level I/O events from the ``LD_PRELOAD``
library via ``IOEventDispatcher`` → ``_PreloadBridge``.  This means DPOR
detects races involving opaque C extensions (e.g. psycopg2/libpq calling
libc ``send()``/``recv()`` directly) that previously went unnoticed.

**Improved DPOR race detection**

- Global variable and module-level attribute accesses are now tracked as
  shared-memory conflicts.
- C-level container mutations (``list.append``, ``dict.__setitem__``, etc.)
  detected via ``sys.setprofile``.
- Closure variable (``LOAD_DEREF`` / ``STORE_DEREF``) accesses tracked.
- Builtin function calls that mutate containers (e.g. ``sorted()``,
  ``list()``) treated as reads on their arguments.
- Container iteration (``GET_ITER`` / ``FOR_ITER``) tracked as reads.
- Known limitation: C-level iteration interleaving (e.g.
  ``list(od.keys())`` vs ``OrderedDict.move_to_end()``, or ``itertools``
  combinators racing with mutations) is undetectable at the opcode level.
  See ``PEP-703-REPORT.md``.

**Other changes**

- Cooperative threading primitives (``Lock``, ``RLock``, ``Semaphore``,
  ``Event``, ``Condition``, ``Queue``, etc.) extracted to a shared module so
  both the bytecode explorer and DPOR use the same wrappers.
- Deadlock detection via wait-for graph cycle detection.
- ``--frontrun-patch-locks`` pytest plugin for early cooperative patching;
  tests that need the frontrun environment are auto-skipped when it is absent.
- Free-threaded Python (3.13t, 3.14t) support, including a fix for a PyO3
  "Already borrowed" panic and intermittent hangs in cooperative lock
  patching on 3.14t.
- Multi-version test matrix: Python 3.10, 3.14, 3.14t.
- ``DporResult`` merged into ``InterleavingResult``; all three ``explore_*``
  functions return the same type.
- Improved ``_dpor`` import error with build instructions.
