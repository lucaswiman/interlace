This module contains the low-level synchronization classes used by both
:mod:`frontrun.trace_markers` (threads) and :mod:`frontrun.async_trace_markers`
(async tasks running in threads).  Both modules re-export these names so the
historical public API (``from frontrun.trace_markers import MarkerRegistry,
