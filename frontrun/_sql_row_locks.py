"""DPOR row-lock acquire/release helpers for SQL interception.

Row locks are scheduler-level locks (in the DPOR engine) tracking which
rows a transaction holds. They are populated by ``_report_or_buffer``
inside ``_sql_transactions`` (which writes ``_io_tls._pending_row_locks``)
and drained here at the next scheduling point.

Kept separate from ``_sql_cursor.py`` so the DPOR-context glue is
isolated from cursor patching.
