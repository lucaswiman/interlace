"""
Deadlock detection for frontrun schedulers.

Provides two complementary detection mechanisms:

1. **All-threads-waiting detection** (option 1): When every non-done thread
   is parked inside ``wait_for_turn()`` and none of them is the scheduled
   thread, no progress is possible.  The scheduler can detect this instantly
   instead of waiting for a timeout.

2. **Wait-for graph cycle detection** (option 3): Cooperative primitives
   register ``(thread, lock)`` waiting/holding edges.  A cycle in the
   resulting directed graph means a true lock-ordering deadlock.

Both mechanisms fire instantly when the deadlock condition is met.  A
fallback wall-clock timeout is still kept for threads stuck in C extensions
or other unmanaged blocking calls.
