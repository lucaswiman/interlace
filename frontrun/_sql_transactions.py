"""Transaction grouping for SQL interception.

Tracks transaction state on the per-thread :data:`_io_tls` so that:

* I/O reports inside a transaction can be **buffered** and flushed atomically
  on COMMIT (or discarded on ROLLBACK), preserving transactional atomicity
  for the DPOR scheduler.
* **Autobegin** transactions (psycopg2's default ``autocommit=False`` mode,
  where the first statement implicitly opens a transaction) are detected
  even though no explicit ``BEGIN`` flows through ``cursor.execute()``.
* **Savepoints** are honored via buffer-index bookmarks: ``ROLLBACK TO``
  truncates the buffer back to the savepoint's index.
* DPOR row-locks are released on COMMIT/ROLLBACK.

State lives on :data:`_io_tls` (shared with ``_sql_cursor``):

* ``_in_transaction`` — bool
* ``_is_autobegin``   — bool (autobegin reports immediately, like
  READ COMMITTED, instead of buffering)
* ``_tx_buffer``      — list of pending ``(res_id, kind)`` tuples
* ``_tx_savepoints``  — dict mapping savepoint name to buffer index
* ``_pending_row_locks`` — list of resource IDs needing DPOR row-lock
  arbitration (drained by ``_sql_row_locks._acquire_pending_row_locks``)
