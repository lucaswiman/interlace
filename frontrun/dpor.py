"""
Bytecode-tracing DPOR (Dynamic Partial Order Reduction) for frontrun.

This module implements systematic interleaving exploration using DPOR,
completely separate from the existing bytecode.py random exploration.

The approach:
1. A Rust DPOR engine (frontrun._dpor) manages the exploration tree,
   vector clocks, and backtrack set computation.
2. Python drives execution: runs threads under sys.settrace opcode
   tracing, uses a shadow stack to detect shared-memory accesses,
   and feeds access/sync events to the Rust engine.
3. Cooperative threading primitives (lock, event, etc.) are monkey-patched
   to yield control back to the DPOR scheduler and report synchronization
   events for happens-before tracking.

Usage::

    from frontrun.dpor import explore_dpor

    class Counter:
        def __init__(self):
            self.value = 0
        def increment(self):
            temp = self.value
            self.value = temp + 1

    result = explore_dpor(
        setup=lambda: Counter(),
        threads=[lambda c: c.increment(), lambda c: c.increment()],
        invariant=lambda c: c.value == 2,
    )
    assert result.property_holds, result.explanation  # fails — lost update!

    """Systematically explore interleavings using DPOR.

    This is the DPOR replacement for ``explore_interleavings()``. Instead of
    random sampling, it uses the DPOR algorithm to explore only distinct
    interleavings (modulo independent operation reordering).

    Args:
        setup: Creates fresh shared state for each execution.
        threads: List of callables, each receiving the shared state.
        invariant: Predicate over shared state; must be True after all
            threads complete.
        max_executions: Safety limit on total executions (None = unlimited).
        preemption_bound: Limit on preemptions per execution. 2 catches most
            bugs. None = unbounded (full DPOR).
        max_branches: Maximum scheduling points per execution.
        timeout_per_run: Timeout for each individual run.
        stop_on_first: If True (default), stop exploring as soon as the
            first invariant violation is found.  Set to False to collect
            all failing interleavings.
        detect_io: Automatically detect socket/file I/O operations and
            report them as resource accesses (default True).  Two threads
            accessing the same endpoint or file will be treated as
            conflicting, enabling DPOR to explore their orderings.
        deadlock_timeout: Seconds to wait before declaring a deadlock
            (default 5.0).  Increase for code that legitimately blocks
            in C extensions (NumPy, database queries, network I/O).
        reproduce_on_failure: When a counterexample is found, replay the
            same schedule this many times to measure reproducibility
            (default 10).  Set to 0 to skip reproduction testing.
        total_timeout: Maximum total time in seconds for the entire
            exploration (default None = unlimited).  When exceeded, returns
            results gathered so far.
        warn_nondeterministic_sql: If True (default), raise
            :class:`~frontrun.common.NondeterministicSQLError` when SQL
            INSERT statements are detected but ``lastrowid`` capture
            failed (e.g. psycopg2 without RETURNING).  Set to False to
            suppress.  When capture succeeds, INSERTs use stable
            indexical resource IDs automatically.

    Returns:
        InterleavingResult with exploration statistics and any counterexample found.
