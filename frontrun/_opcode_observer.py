"""Opcode-level shadow stack and shared-memory access detection.

Mirrors CPython's evaluation stack at bytecode granularity to identify
which Python objects are being read or written by each opcode.  Reports
detected accesses to the Rust DPOR engine for systematic interleaving
exploration.

This module is used by both ``dpor.py`` (sync threads) and
``async_dpor.py`` (async tasks).  It is deliberately decoupled from the
scheduler implementations — the only requirement is that the caller
provides an object satisfying the narrow interface used by
``_process_opcode`` (engine, execution, lock, shadow stacks, stable IDs).

#   detect_io             — affects dynamic-code filtering
#   is_active()           — early-out when scheduler is done (sync only)

        ``() -> bool`` or ``None``.  When provided, the trace function
        returns ``None`` (disabling tracing) if ``is_active()`` is False.
