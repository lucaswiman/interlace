"""Shared row-lock registry used by sync (DporScheduler) and async (AsyncDporScheduler)."""

class RowLockRegistry:
    """Tracks SQL SELECT FOR UPDATE row-lock ownership and integer IDs.

    Both ``DporScheduler`` (sync) and ``AsyncDporScheduler`` (async) maintain
    identical state for row-lock tracking:

    * ``_active_row_locks``  — resource_id → holder thread/task ID
    * ``_task_row_locks``    — thread/task ID → set of held resource IDs
    * ``_row_lock_ids``      — resource_id → stable integer ID for WaitForGraph
    * ``_row_lock_next_id``  — monotonic counter for ID allocation

    This class holds that shared state and exposes three shared operations:

    * ``_row_lock_int_id(res_id)`` — stable monotonic int ID, byte-for-byte
      identical in both schedulers.
    * ``record_acquire(owner_id, res_id, graph)`` — update ownership dicts and
      call ``graph.add_holding`` after the caller decides to proceed.  Both
      schedulers run this after their (divergent) blocking/non-blocking decisions.
    * ``pop_all(owner_id, graph)`` — release all locks for *owner_id*, call
      ``graph.remove_holding`` for each, return ``(res_id, int_id)`` pairs so the
      sync scheduler can call ``engine.report_sync`` (async does not).
    * ``id_to_resource()`` — inverse mapping passed to ``format_cycle``.

    The blocking-vs-non-blocking acquire loop remains scheduler-specific because
    the async scheduler cannot block (single event-loop thread) while the sync
    scheduler waits on a condition variable.
