"""Shared concurrency primitives unifying sync (threaded) and async DPOR drivers.

The sync driver in :mod:`frontrun._dpor_runtime` and the async driver in
:mod:`frontrun.async_dpor` share the same outer-loop shape but historically
diverged on two small concurrency-shaped details:

* The **engine lock** — sync DPOR runs workers on real threads, so PyO3
  ``&mut self`` borrows on the Rust ``PyDporEngine`` need a real
  :class:`threading.Lock` to serialise them (panics rather than blocks on
  free-threaded Python).  Async DPOR runs all tasks on a single event-loop
  thread, so it uses a no-op context manager.

* The **per-execution boundary** — both drivers loop ``while True``,
  reset per-execution state, call ``engine.begin_execution()``, run the
  workers, then call ``engine.next_execution()`` (and bail out on a
  ``total_timeout`` deadline).  The body of each iteration is necessarily
  driver-specific (threads vs tasks, sync vs ``await``), but the
  *boundary* is identical.

This module exposes both pieces:

* :class:`NoOpLock` — context-manager-shaped no-op lock for async DPOR.
* :func:`dpor_exploration_iter` — generator that yields one
  :class:`ExplorationStep` per execution, holding the engine lock while
  it advances the engine.  The caller (sync or async) owns the body.
