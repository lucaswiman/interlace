"""
Frontrun: Deterministic async task interleaving using comment-based markers.

This module provides a mechanism to control async task execution order by marking
synchronization points in code with ``# frontrun: marker_name`` comments,
matching the elegant syntax of the sync trace_markers module.

Key Insight: Thread-Based Execution with sys.settrace
======================================================

This implementation mirrors the sync architecture exactly:

1. Each async task runs in its own thread via ``asyncio.run(task_fn())``
2. ``sys.settrace`` fires on every line, including inside synchronous sub-coroutines
3. When a marker is detected, the trace function blocks the thread via
   ``ThreadCoordinator.wait_for_turn()``
4. Execution resumes exactly where it paused

This solves the synchronous function body bug: when ``await self.get_balance()``
completes synchronously (no internal yields), the trace still fires on every
line during that execution. After ``get_balance()`` returns, the trace fires for
the next line (after the marker), detects the marker, and blocks before that
line executes.

Marker Semantics
=================

**Marker Placement**: Place markers to gate the operations you want to control.

Inline markers (marker on same line as operation):
    current = self.balance  # frontrun: read_balance

Separate-line markers (marker before operation):
    # frontrun: read_balance
    current = self.balance

Both styles work identically: the marker gates execution of the line, ensuring
it only executes after the scheduler approves this task at this marker.

Example usage::

    async def worker_function():
        # frontrun: read_data
        x = await read_data()
        # frontrun: write_data
        await write_data(x)

    schedule = Schedule([
        Step("task1", "read_data"),
        Step("task2", "read_data"),
        Step("task1", "write_data"),
        Step("task2", "write_data"),
    ])

    executor = AsyncTraceExecutor(schedule)
    executor.run({
        'task1': worker_function,
        'task2': worker_function,
    })

Or using the convenience function::

    async_frontrun(
        schedule=schedule,
        tasks={'task1': worker1, 'task2': worker2},
    )
