"""Unified entry point for frontrun interleaving exploration.

This module provides :func:`explore`, a single function that dispatches to the
appropriate underlying implementation based on worker type and strategy.

Examples::

    from frontrun import explore

    # Sync DPOR (default)
    result = explore(
        setup=Counter,
        workers=Counter.increment,
        count=2,
        invariant=lambda c: c.value == 2,
    )
    result.assert_holds()

    # Async — detected automatically from coroutine function
    async def worker(state): ...
    result = await explore(setup=make_state, workers=worker, count=2, invariant=...)

    # Strategy selection
    result = explore(..., strategy="dpor")    # default
    result = explore(..., strategy="random")  # formerly explore_interleavings

    """Explore thread/task interleavings for concurrency bugs.

    A unified entry point that dispatches to the appropriate underlying
    implementation based on worker type (sync vs async) and strategy.

    Args:
        setup: Creates fresh shared state for each execution.
        workers: A callable (when ``count`` is provided) or a list/tuple of
            callables. Sync callables run as threads; async callables (coroutine
            functions) run as asyncio tasks.
        invariant: Predicate over shared state; must be True after all
            workers complete.
        count: When ``workers`` is a single callable, replicate it this many
            times. Must be positive. Cannot be used when ``workers`` is a
            list/tuple.
        strategy: ``"dpor"`` (default) for systematic DPOR exploration, or
            ``"random"`` for random schedule sampling (formerly
            ``explore_interleavings``).
        max_executions: Safety limit on total executions (DPOR only).
        preemption_bound: Limit on preemptions per execution (DPOR only).
        max_branches: Maximum scheduling points per execution (DPOR only).
        timeout_per_run: Timeout for each individual run.
        stop_on_first: Stop on first invariant violation (DPOR only).
        detect_io: Detect socket/file I/O operations as resource accesses.
            For async DPOR, also activates Redis key-level patching.
        deadlock_timeout: Seconds to wait before declaring a deadlock.
        reproduce_on_failure: Replay counterexample this many times.
        total_timeout: Maximum total exploration time in seconds.
        warn_nondeterministic_sql: Raise on nondeterministic SQL INSERT.
        lock_timeout: Auto-set PostgreSQL lock_timeout (milliseconds).
        trace_packages: Package patterns to trace in addition to user code.
        track_dunder_dict_accesses: Report ``obj.__dict__`` accesses (DPOR).
        search: Wakeup-tree traversal strategy (DPOR only).
        patch_sleep: Replace ``time.sleep`` / ``asyncio.sleep`` with no-op.
        serializable_invariant: Check serializability against sequential runs.
        error_on_any_race: Treat unsynchronized races as failures (DPOR only).
        max_attempts: Random schedule samples to try (random strategy only).
        max_ops: Maximum schedule length per attempt (random strategy only).
        seed: RNG seed for reproducibility (random strategy only).
        debug: Enable debug output (random strategy only).
        detect_sql: Patch async SQL drivers (async DPOR only).

    Returns:
        :class:`~frontrun.common.InterleavingResult` (sync) or a coroutine
        that resolves to one (async workers).

    Raises:
        ValueError: If ``count`` and a list of workers are both provided,
            ``count <= 0``, or ``strategy`` is unrecognised.
