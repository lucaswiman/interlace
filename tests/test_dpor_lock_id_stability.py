"""Test that DPOR lock IDs are stable (indexical) across executions.

Regression test: lock IDs used to be raw ``id(self)`` values from
``CooperativeLock``, which changed between executions because each
execution creates fresh state via ``setup()``.  The fix uses
``StableObjectIds`` to assign monotonically increasing IDs that are
consistent across executions.
