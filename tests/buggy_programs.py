"""
Buggy concurrent programs for testing interlace's ability to detect common concurrency bugs.

This module contains intentionally buggy implementations of concurrent data structures
and operations to demonstrate four classes of concurrency bugs:

1. Atomicity Violation - Read-modify-write without proper synchronization
2. Order Violation - Thread uses uninitialized resource
3. Deadlock - Circular lock dependency
4. Async Suspension-Point Race - Async await between read and write
