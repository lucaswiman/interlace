"""Tests for time.sleep and asyncio.sleep patching.

Verifies that:
- time.sleep is replaced with a no-op during exploration
- asyncio.sleep is replaced with a no-op (but still yields) during async exploration
- Sleep patching can be disabled via patch_sleep=False
- Sleep calls act as scheduling points (threads can be preempted at sleep)
