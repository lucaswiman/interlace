"""Defect #13: DPOR false positive — CTE + FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED and single-statement DML.

Problem statement
-----------------

DPOR's SQL conflict model (``_sql_cursor.py`` / ``_sql_parsing.py``) has two
related modeling gaps around PostgreSQL's row-level locking semantics:

**1. ``FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`` is not distinguishable from ``FOR UPDATE``**

    ``parse_sql_access()`` extracts ``lock_intent = LockIntent.UPDATE`` for
    both ``SELECT ... FOR UPDATE`` and ``SELECT ... FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED``.
    The ``SKIP LOCKED`` modifier — which tells PostgreSQL to silently skip
    rows that are already locked by another transaction — is completely
    invisible to the conflict model.

    This matters because ``SKIP LOCKED`` changes the concurrency semantics
    fundamentally: two concurrent ``SELECT FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`` on the
    same table will never return the same row, so they cannot conflict at
    the row level.  But DPOR's model sees two accesses to the same table
    with the same ``LockIntent.UPDATE`` and correctly infers a conflict.

    For single-statement CTEs (``WITH cte AS (SELECT ... FOR UPDATE SKIP
    LOCKED) UPDATE ...``), this is currently harmless because each
    ``cursor.execute()`` call is one atomic scheduling point.  But if a
    future refactoring splits the CTE into separate SELECT + UPDATE
    statements (as ORM layers sometimes do), the conflict model would
    create false backtrack points.

**2. Single-statement DML atomicity is not modeled**

    Two concurrent ``DELETE FROM t WHERE id = 1 RETURNING id`` always
    serialize at the row level in PostgreSQL: the first transaction locks
    the row and deletes it; the second blocks until the first commits,
    then finds the row gone and returns nothing.  DPOR's conflict model
    sees two write accesses to the same table and would explore an
    interleaving where both succeed — but this interleaving is impossible
    in real PostgreSQL.

    Again, this is currently harmless for single-statement operations
    (one scheduling point per execute), but the conflict model does not
    represent the constraint that these operations serialize.

**Current impact:**

    With single-statement SQL (which is the common case for pgmq-style
    dequeue), DPOR handles these patterns correctly because each
    ``cursor.execute()`` is indivisible.  The false positive described in
    the original defect report may require a multi-statement implementation
    or specific library internals that create additional scheduling points
    within the transaction.

    The tests below verify:
    - The SQL parsing gap (``SKIP LOCKED`` is invisible)
    - That single-statement patterns are correctly handled
    - That split-statement patterns (SELECT + UPDATE separately) could
      create false backtrack points, though Postgres row locking still
      prevents the invariant violation at execution time
