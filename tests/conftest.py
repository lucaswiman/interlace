"""
Pytest plugin for interlace - deterministic concurrency testing.

This plugin provides fixtures and hooks for using interlace with pytest,
enabling monkey-patching of threading.Lock when tests need deterministic
thread scheduling.

Usage:
    - Place this conftest.py in your tests directory
    - Use interlace fixtures directly, or mark tests with @pytest.mark.interlace
    - Fixtures will automatically patch threading.Lock for those tests
