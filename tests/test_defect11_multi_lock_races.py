"""Defect #11 (FIXED): DPOR detects races between two separate lock objects.

Problem statement
-----------------

A common real-world race pattern involves a **compound operation** that
updates two separately-locked values in sequence, where a concurrent reader
observes the values *between* the two updates and sees an inconsistent
snapshot:

    # Thread A (writer — "observe"):
    with count_lock:                 # Lock 1
        count._value += 1
    # << race window: count incremented, sum not yet >>
    with sum_lock:                   # Lock 2
        sum._value += amount

    # Thread B (reader — "collect"):
    with count_lock:                 # Lock 1
        c = count._value             # sees count incremented
    with sum_lock:                   # Lock 2
        s = sum._value               # but sum not yet incremented → c > s

This is the pattern used by ``prometheus_client.Summary.observe()``.

How DPOR detects this
---------------------

The fix has two parts:

1. **Lock-based happens-before fixed**: Lock release now stores the
   releasing thread's ``dpor_vv`` (previously stored ``causality``, which
   was never incremented and always zero).  This ensures data accesses
   inside the same critical section are correctly ordered by HB.

2. **Lock operations create backtrack points**: Lock acquire is reported
   as a Write I/O access to a virtual lock object, using ``io_vv`` (which
   doesn't include lock-based HB) and first-access semantics.  This makes
   lock acquires on the same lock by different threads appear concurrent,
   creating backtrack points at lock boundaries.

Together, these changes let DPOR explore the ordering where Thread B runs
its entire count_lock + sum_lock sequence *between* Thread A's two
critical sections — finding the count=1, sum=0 invariant violation.
