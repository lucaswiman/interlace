"""
Tests demonstrating interlace's ability to detect four classes of concurrency bugs.

For each bug class, we have three types of tests:
1. Exact reproduction using trace_markers/async_trace_markers with a specific Schedule
2. Property-based exploration using bytecode/async_bytecode with explore_interleavings
3. Hypothesis-based testing using bytecode/async_bytecode with schedule_strategy

Bug classes covered:
1. Atomicity Violation - Read-modify-write without locking
2. Order Violation - Thread uses uninitialized resource
3. Deadlock - Circular lock dependency
4. Async Suspension-Point Race - Await between read and write
