"""Mazurkiewicz trace counts for simple concurrent programs.

Verifies that DPOR explores exactly the theoretically predicted number of
Mazurkiewicz traces for several families of concurrent programs.  Each test
includes a proof that the predicted trace count is tight (both a lower and
upper bound).

Important: those proofs are stated against the **intended logical event
model** of each program, not necessarily the full Python opcode-level event
alphabet that the current implementation explores.  Where we know a case is
exact even under the current Python event alphabet, the test says so
explicitly.

Categories:
1. N threads mutating independent state  → 1 trace
2. Two threads racing on N shared vars   → 2^N traces
3. N threads serialized by a single lock → N! traces
4. (2) but with a lock                   → 2 traces
5. File I/O and PostgreSQL integration   → analogous counts

If the DPOR implementation finds more or fewer traces than the theoretical
bound, the test is left failing so deviations are visible.

        The proof below is for the intended logical event model where each
        ``v.value = tid`` is treated as one write event on slot ``v``.

        For ``n == 1``, this bound is also exact under the current Python
        event alphabet: after the trace-cache merge fix, the only cross-thread
        dependent pair is the two ``STORE_ATTR value`` writes to the shared
        ``_Slot`` object, so the exact count is still 2.

        For ``n > 1``, the current implementation still explores a finer
        opcode-level alphabet than the proof below assumes, so the asserted
        bound should be read as the semantic target rather than a proven bound
        for the current instrumentation.

        Proof of tightness for the logical event model:

        Let a_i denote thread A's write to variable v_i and b_i denote
        thread B's write to v_i, for i = 1, …, N.

        Program order within each thread:
            a_1 < a_2 < … < a_N
            b_1 < b_2 < … < b_N

        Dependency relation D:
            (a_i, b_i) ∈ D for each i (write–write conflict on the same
            Python object v_i).  All other cross-thread pairs (a_i, b_j)
            with i ≠ j are independent (different objects).

        A Mazurkiewicz trace is uniquely determined by the total order it
        induces on each dependent pair.  For pair i, either a_i ≺ b_i or
        b_i ≺ a_i in the trace.

        Upper bound ≤ 2^N:
            There are at most 2^N choices for the N dependent pairs.

        Lower bound ≥ 2^N (all combinations are realizable):
            Fix any assignment σ: {1,…,N} → {A, B}, where σ(i) = A means
            "a_i before b_i."  Construct a linearization L by scanning
            i = 1, …, N:
              • If σ(i) = A, append a_i then b_i.
              • If σ(i) = B, append b_i then a_i.
            Claim: L respects both program orders.
            Within thread A, a_i appears at position 2i−1 or 2i, and
            a_{i+1} at position 2(i+1)−1 or 2(i+1), so a_i < a_{i+1}.
            Symmetrically for thread B.  ∎

    When a thread performs SQL via psycopg2, the I/O suppression mechanism
    (suppress_tid_permanently) may incorrectly suppress *all* file I/O events
    from that thread — including plain open()/write() calls that have nothing
    to do with the database socket.  This causes DPOR to miss file-level
    conflicts and under-count Mazurkiewicz traces.

        Each thread:
            1. Opens a psycopg2 connection, does SELECT FOR UPDATE + UPDATE + COMMIT on row1.
            2. Writes its tid to a shared file (plain open() + write()).

        The SQL serialises via the row lock (2 orderings).  The file write
        is an *independent* conflict point — it can be ordered independently
        of the SQL, so total traces should be > 2.

        With the suppress_tid_permanently bug, the file I/O events from
        threads that touched psycopg2 are silently dropped, so DPOR only
        sees the SQL conflicts and reports exactly 2 traces.
