"""Defect #11: GC destructor deadlock with CooperativeRLock.

CooperativeRLock.release() is missing the _in_dpor_machinery() reentrancy
guard that CooperativeLock.release() has.  When GC fires during
_report_and_wait (which holds scheduler._condition and sets
_in_dpor_machinery=True), redis.Redis.__del__ can trigger
connection_pool.disconnect() which uses an RLock.  The RLock.release()
calls _report("lock_release") which tries to acquire scheduler._condition,
causing a deadlock.

Fix: add the same guard to CooperativeRLock.release().
