"""Corrected bank transfer: a single lock makes all interleavings safe.

This is the locked counterpart to ``dpor_bank_transfer.py``.  Adding a
shared ``threading.Lock`` around each transfer makes the operations atomic:
DPOR can only reorder the two lock acquisitions (T1 first vs T2 first), so
it explores far fewer interleavings — all of which leave the total at 300.

Compare against ``dpor_bank_transfer.py`` to see how locking reduces both
the number of explored paths and the number of failures.

Usage::
