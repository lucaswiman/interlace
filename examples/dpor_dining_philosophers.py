"""Dining philosophers (3 philosophers): lock-ordering deadlock.

Three philosophers sit at a round table.  Each needs both the left and right
fork (a ``threading.Lock``) to eat.  They always pick up the left fork first,
then try for the right — a classic circular wait that deadlocks.

There is no shared state to update; the invariant is always ``True``.  DPOR
finds the deadlock directly via its wait-for-graph cycle detector.

The exploration can produce up to ``max_executions`` interleavings before
stopping.  With ``stop_on_first=False`` and a generous limit you can see both
deadlocking and non-deadlocking schedules in the report.
