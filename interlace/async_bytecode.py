"""
Await-point-level deterministic async concurrency testing.

Uses the shared InterleavedLoop abstraction to control which async task
resumes at each await point, enabling fine-grained control over task
interleaving.

This pairs naturally with property-based testing: rather than specifying exact
schedules, generate random interleavings and check that invariants hold (or
that bugs can be found).

The core insight: in async Python, context switches happen ONLY at await
points. The event loop is single-threaded. By controlling which task resumes
at each await point, we can explore the full space of possible interleavings —
and there are far fewer of them than in threaded code.

Example — find a race condition with random schedule exploration:

    >>> import asyncio
    >>> from interlace.async_bytecode import explore_interleavings, await_point
    >>>
    >>> class Counter:
    ...     def __init__(self):
    ...         self.value = 0
    ...     async def increment(self):
    ...         temp = self.value
    ...         await await_point()  # Yield control; race can happen here
    ...         self.value = temp + 1
    >>>
    >>> result = asyncio.run(explore_interleavings(
    ...     setup=lambda: Counter(),
    ...     tasks=[lambda c: c.increment(), lambda c: c.increment()],
    ...     invariant=lambda c: c.value == 2,
    ... ))
    >>> assert not result.property_holds  # race condition found!

The await_point() function marks explicit yield points where context switches
can occur. This is analogous to bytecode.py's opcode-level tracing, but for
async code the number of interleaving points is much smaller and more explicit.

In production async code, every `await` is a potential context switch point.
For testing, call `await await_point()` at each location where a race
condition could manifest.
