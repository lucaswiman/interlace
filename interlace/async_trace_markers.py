"""
Interlace: Deterministic async task interleaving using explicit markers.

This module provides a mechanism to control async task execution order by marking
synchronization points in code with explicit await calls that enforce a predefined
execution schedule. This is the async/await adaptation of the threading-based
trace_markers module.

Built on the shared InterleavedLoop abstraction, using step-based scheduling
(list of Step(execution_name, marker_name) entries) as its policy.

Key Insight: In async code, race conditions ONLY happen at await points
============================================================================

Unlike threading where race conditions can occur at any line of code (because the OS
can preempt threads at any time), async code in Python uses cooperative multitasking
with a single-threaded event loop. The event loop only yields control at explicit
`await` statements. This means:

1. Race conditions between tasks can ONLY manifest at await points
2. Code between await points runs atomically (no interleaving)
3. We don't need sys.settrace - we can use explicit checkpoint functions

Translation from Threading to Async:
- Thread → Task (coroutine scheduled on event loop)
- # interlace: marker_name comment → await mark('marker_name') call
- sys.settrace() → explicit await checkpoints
- threading.Condition → asyncio.Condition (via InterleavedLoop)

The marker functions are designed to be lightweight and minimally invasive - they
serve the same role as comment markers in the threading version, but work naturally
with async's cooperative scheduling model.

Example usage:
    ```python
    async def worker_function(mark):
        x = await read_data()
        await mark('after_read')  # explicit marker point
        await write_data(x)
        await mark('after_write')

    schedule = Schedule([
        Step("task1", "after_read"),
        Step("task2", "after_read"),
        Step("task1", "after_write"),
        Step("task2", "after_write"),
    ])

    async def main():
        executor = AsyncTraceExecutor(schedule)
        mark1 = executor.marker('task1')
        mark2 = executor.marker('task2')

        await executor.run({
            'task1': lambda: worker_function(mark1),
            'task2': lambda: worker_function(mark2),
        })

    asyncio.run(main())
    ```

Or using the convenience function:
    ```python
    await async_interlace(
        schedule=schedule,
        tasks={'task1': worker1, 'task2': worker2},
    )
    ```
