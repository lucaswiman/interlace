DPOR in Practice
================

This is a practical guide to using ``explore_dpor()`` for systematic
concurrency testing. For the underlying algorithm and theory, see
:doc:`dpor`.


What DPOR does
--------------

DPOR and the invariant have separate jobs:

- **DPOR decides which interleavings to run.** It watches every shared-memory
  access, detects which operations *conflict* (access the same object with at
  least one write), and uses that information to skip redundant orderings.
  Two interleavings that only differ in the order of independent operations
  (e.g. two reads, or accesses to different objects) are equivalent, so DPOR
  runs only one representative from each equivalence class.

- **The invariant decides whether a bug occurred.** After all threads finish,
  ``explore_dpor()`` calls your invariant on the final state. DPOR has no
  built-in notion of "correct" --- it doesn't know that ``counter == 1`` is
  wrong and ``counter == 2`` is right. You supply that judgement via the
  invariant.

(The name "invariant" is standard in tools like this --- loom, CHESS, etc. ---
even though it is technically a *postcondition* checked once after the threads
finish, not a continuously-monitored loop invariant.)

Putting the two together:

.. code-block:: python

   from frontrun.dpor import explore_dpor

   result = explore_dpor(
       setup=MyState,                         # called fresh each execution
       threads=[thread_a, thread_b],          # each receives the state
       invariant=lambda s: s.is_consistent(), # checked after all threads finish
   )

   assert result.property_holds, result.explanation

1. DPOR picks an interleaving (based on conflict analysis).
2. ``setup()`` creates fresh state; the threads run under that interleaving.
3. The invariant checks the final state.
4. Repeat until all distinct interleavings are covered.


What it can and cannot find
---------------------------

DPOR explores alternative interleavings only where it detects a *conflict*
--- two threads accessing the same object with at least one write. It detects
conflicts by instrumenting Python bytecode, so only operations that are
visible at the bytecode level register as conflicts.

**Operations DPOR sees (and will explore reorderings of):**

- Attribute reads and writes (``self.x``, ``obj.field = ...``)
- Subscript reads and writes (``d[key]``, ``lst[i] = ...``)
- Lock acquire and release (``threading.Lock``, ``threading.RLock``)
- Thread spawn and join
- **Socket I/O** (``connect``, ``send``, ``sendall``, ``sendto``, ``recv``,
  ``recv_into``, ``recvfrom``) --- detected via automatic monkey-patching
  when ``detect_io=True`` (the default). Two threads accessing the same
  ``host:port`` endpoint conflict; different endpoints are independent.
- **File opens** (``builtins.open``) --- read vs write determined by mode,
  resource identity from the resolved file path.

Beyond invariant violations, DPOR also detects **deadlocks** (via wait-for-graph
cycle detection) and **crashes** (unhandled exceptions in any thread are
re-raised after the execution completes).

**Operations DPOR does not see (and will therefore not explore):**

- **Database operations.** Two threads calling ``cursor.execute("UPDATE ...")``
  on the same row look like independent C function calls to the tracer ---
  DPOR sees no conflict between them and only runs one interleaving.
- **Opaque C-extension I/O.** Database drivers, Redis clients, and other
  libraries that manage sockets entirely in C code bypass the
  monkey-patches, so their operations appear independent.
- **C-extension shared state.** Shared state modified inside C code (NumPy
  arrays, etc.) is not tracked at the bytecode level.

The consequence is not that DPOR "can't run" on such code --- it will run
fine, it just won't explore the interesting schedules. Because the external
operations look independent, DPOR concludes that reordering them cannot change
the outcome and skips all the alternative interleavings where the bugs hide.

For these cases, there are two alternatives:

- **Bytecode exploration** (``explore_interleavings()``) doesn't need to
  *understand* why a schedule is bad --- it checks an invariant after each run
  and reports when the invariant fails.  If a C extension mutates shared state
  in a way that breaks your invariant, bytecode exploration will often find the
  bad interleaving by chance.  It won't know *why* it's bad (the error trace
  is less interpretable than DPOR's), but it will find it.  See
  :doc:`approaches` for details.

- **Trace markers** let you annotate the points where interleaving matters and
  enumerate the orderings by hand.  This is the most reliable approach when you
  already know the race window.

Thread functions should also avoid external side effects (writing to files,
sending network requests, modifying global state outside the ``setup`` object).
DPOR replays each interleaving from scratch, so side effects from one replay
will interfere with the next.


Basic usage
-----------

The ``explore_dpor()`` function is the main entry point:

.. code-block:: python

   from frontrun.dpor import explore_dpor

   class Counter:
       def __init__(self):
           self.value = 0

       def increment(self):
           temp = self.value
           self.value = temp + 1

   result = explore_dpor(
       setup=Counter,
       threads=[lambda c: c.increment(), lambda c: c.increment()],
       invariant=lambda c: c.value == 2,
   )

   assert result.property_holds, result.explanation

**Parameters:**

``setup``
    A callable that creates fresh shared state. Called once per execution so
    that each interleaving starts from a clean slate.

``threads``
    A list of callables, each receiving the state returned by ``setup``.
    The length of this list determines the number of threads.

``invariant``
    A predicate over the shared state that defines what "correct" means.
    Called after all threads finish each execution. Return ``True`` if the
    state is valid, ``False`` if there is a bug. DPOR decides *which*
    interleavings to try; the invariant decides *whether each one passed*.

``preemption_bound`` *(default: 2)*
    Maximum number of preemptions (context switches away from a runnable
    thread) per execution. A bound of 2 catches the vast majority of real
    bugs. Set to ``None`` for unbounded exploration, but be aware that
    this can be exponentially slower.

``max_executions`` *(default: None)*
    Safety cap on total executions. Useful for CI where you want a time
    bound.

``max_branches`` *(default: 100,000)*
    Maximum scheduling points per execution. Prevents runaway on programs
    with very long traces.

``timeout_per_run`` *(default: 5.0)*
    Timeout in seconds for each individual execution.

``reproduce_on_failure`` *(default: 10)*
    When a counterexample is found, replay the same schedule this many
    times to measure how reproducible the failure is. The reproduction
    count and percentage appear in ``result.explanation``. Set to 0 to
    skip.


Interpreting results
--------------------

``explore_dpor()`` returns an ``InterleavingResult`` (the same type used by
``explore_interleavings``):

.. code-block:: python

   @dataclass
   class InterleavingResult:
       property_holds: bool                              # True if invariant held everywhere
       num_explored: int = 0                             # total interleavings tried
       counterexample: list[int] | None = None           # first failing schedule
       failures: list[tuple[int, list[int]]] = ...       # all (execution_num, schedule) pairs
       explanation: str | None = None                    # human-readable trace of the race
       reproduction_attempts: int = 0                    # number of replay attempts
       reproduction_successes: int = 0                   # how many replays reproduced the failure

``counterexample`` is a list of thread IDs representing the order in
which threads were scheduled. For example, ``[0, 0, 1, 1]`` means thread 0
ran for two steps, then thread 1 ran for two steps.

When a race is found, ``explanation`` contains a formatted trace showing the
interleaved source lines, the conflict pattern (lost update, write-write, etc.),
and reproduction statistics. This is the same output for both ``explore_dpor``
and ``explore_interleavings``.

If ``num_explored`` is 1, your threads probably don't share any
state --- the engine saw no conflicts and skipped everything. This is a sign
that either the test is trivially correct or the shared state is not being
accessed in a way the tracer can see (e.g. through a C extension).


Example: verifying that a lock fixes a race
--------------------------------------------

A common pattern is to first show that a race exists, then show that adding
a lock eliminates it:

.. code-block:: python

   import threading
   from frontrun.dpor import explore_dpor

   class UnsafeCounter:
       def __init__(self):
           self.value = 0

       def increment(self):
           temp = self.value
           self.value = temp + 1

   class SafeCounter:
       def __init__(self):
           self.value = 0
           self.lock = threading.Lock()

       def increment(self):
           with self.lock:
               temp = self.value
               self.value = temp + 1

   def test_unsafe_counter_has_race():
       result = explore_dpor(
           setup=UnsafeCounter,
           threads=[lambda c: c.increment(), lambda c: c.increment()],
           invariant=lambda c: c.value == 2,
       )
       assert result.property_holds, result.explanation  # fails — has a race!

   def test_safe_counter_is_correct():
       result = explore_dpor(
           setup=SafeCounter,
           threads=[lambda c: c.increment(), lambda c: c.increment()],
           invariant=lambda c: c.value == 2,
       )
       assert result.property_holds, result.explanation


Example: multiple shared objects
---------------------------------

DPOR tracks objects independently, so races on different attributes are
detected separately:

.. code-block:: python

   from frontrun.dpor import explore_dpor

   class Bank:
       def __init__(self):
           self.a = 100
           self.b = 100

       def transfer(self, amount):
           temp_a = self.a
           temp_b = self.b
           self.a = temp_a - amount
           self.b = temp_b + amount

   def test_concurrent_transfers_conserve_total():
       result = explore_dpor(
           setup=Bank,
           threads=[lambda b: b.transfer(50), lambda b: b.transfer(50)],
           invariant=lambda b: b.a + b.b == 200,
       )
       assert result.property_holds, result.explanation  # fails — total is not conserved


C-level I/O interception via ``LD_PRELOAD``
----------------------------------------------

When run under the ``frontrun`` CLI, the ``LD_PRELOAD`` library
(``libfrontrun_io.so``) intercepts C-level I/O --- including opaque
database drivers like psycopg2/libpq. DPOR consumes these events
automatically when ``detect_io=True`` (the default).

**How it works:**

1. ``explore_dpor()`` starts an ``IOEventDispatcher`` that creates
   an ``os.pipe()`` and passes the write-end FD to the Rust
   ``LD_PRELOAD`` library via the ``FRONTRUN_IO_FD`` environment
   variable. The Rust library writes event records to the pipe for
   every intercepted ``send``, ``recv``, ``read``, ``write``, etc.

2. A ``_PreloadBridge`` maps OS thread IDs (from each event's ``tid``
   field) to DPOR logical thread IDs. Each DPOR-managed thread
   registers its ``threading.get_native_id()`` → ``thread_id`` at
   start.

3. At each DPOR scheduling point, the bridge drains buffered events
   for the current thread and feeds them to the Rust DPOR engine via
   ``engine.report_io_access()``. The engine tracks the shared
   resource (e.g. ``socket:127.0.0.1:5432``) the same way it tracks
   Python-level attribute accesses --- via vector clocks and
   conflict detection.

This is what allows DPOR to detect the SQLAlchemy/psycopg2 lost-update
race (see :doc:`orm_race`): even though psycopg2 calls libc ``send()``
/ ``recv()`` directly (bypassing Python's ``socket`` module), the
``LD_PRELOAD`` library intercepts those calls and DPOR treats the
shared socket endpoint as a conflict point.

.. note::

   The bytecode explorer does *not* consume ``LD_PRELOAD`` events.
   It relies on random scheduling and may still find C-level races
   by chance, but it has no awareness of the underlying I/O conflicts.


ORM helpers: ``django_dpor`` and ``sqlalchemy_dpor``
------------------------------------------------------

Writing correct ``explore_dpor()`` tests against a real database requires
boilerplate: each thread needs its own connection, stale connections from a
previous execution must be closed, and optional lock timeouts must be injected
before the thread runs. The ``frontrun.contrib`` package provides ready-made
wrappers that handle this automatically.

``django_dpor``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: python

   from frontrun.contrib.django import django_dpor

   result = django_dpor(
       setup=_State,
       threads=[thread_a, thread_b],
       invariant=lambda s: s.login_count == 2,
       lock_timeout=500,  # optional, milliseconds
   )
   assert result.property_holds, result.explanation

``django_dpor`` wraps ``explore_dpor`` and:

* Calls ``connections.close_all()`` before each execution so threads open
  fresh connections (avoids sharing a stale connection across DPOR replays).
* Calls ``conn.close()`` / ``conn.ensure_connection()`` at the start of each
  thread so every thread has its own independent connection.
* Optionally executes ``SET lock_timeout = '<N>ms'`` on each connection,
  converting C-level row-lock blocking into a fast PostgreSQL error rather than
  a hang.

All extra keyword arguments are forwarded to ``explore_dpor``.

``sqlalchemy_dpor``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: python

   from frontrun.contrib.sqlalchemy import sqlalchemy_dpor, get_connection

   result = sqlalchemy_dpor(
       engine=engine,
       setup=_State,
       threads=[thread_a, thread_b],
       invariant=lambda s: _read_count() == 2,
       lock_timeout=500,  # optional, milliseconds
   )
   assert result.property_holds, result.explanation

``sqlalchemy_dpor`` wraps ``explore_dpor`` and:

* Calls ``engine.dispose()`` before each execution to close pooled connections.
* Opens a fresh ``engine.connect()`` connection for each thread and stores it
  in a ``ContextVar`` so the thread can retrieve it with ``get_connection()``.
* Optionally executes ``SET lock_timeout = '<N>ms'`` via
  ``conn.exec_driver_sql()``.

Inside a thread function, retrieve the per-thread connection with:

.. code-block:: python

   from frontrun.contrib.sqlalchemy import get_connection

   def thread_fn(state):
       conn = get_connection()
       result = conn.execute(text("SELECT login_count FROM users WHERE id = 1"))
       ...

Both helpers accept ``detect_io=True`` (the default) and all other
``explore_dpor`` keyword arguments.

Async usage
~~~~~~~~~~~

The same ``django_dpor`` and ``sqlalchemy_dpor`` functions also support
async code.  Pass ``tasks=`` instead of ``threads=`` and ``await`` the
result:

.. code-block:: python

   from frontrun.contrib.django import django_dpor

   result = await django_dpor(
       setup=_State,
       tasks=[task_a, task_b],
       invariant=lambda s: s.login_count == 2,
       lock_timeout=500,
   )
   assert result.property_holds, result.explanation

.. code-block:: python

   from frontrun.contrib.sqlalchemy import sqlalchemy_dpor, get_async_connection

   result = await sqlalchemy_dpor(
       engine=async_engine,
       setup=_State,
       tasks=[task_a, task_b],
       invariant=lambda s: _read_count() == 2,
       lock_timeout=500,
   )

Inside an async task, use ``get_async_connection()`` to retrieve the
per-task connection.
