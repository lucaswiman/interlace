Interlace Documentation
=======================

A library for deterministic concurrency testing that helps you reliably reproduce and test race conditions.

Interlace provides tools for controlling thread interleaving at a fine-grained level, allowing you to deterministically reproduce race conditions in tests and verify that your synchronization primitives work correctly.

Key Features
------------

- **Deterministically reproduce race conditions** - Force specific interleavings to make race conditions happen reliably in tests
- **Test concurrent code exhaustively** - Explore different execution orders to find bugs
- **Verify synchronization correctness** - Ensure that proper locking prevents race conditions
- **Lightweight integration** - No need to modify third-party code when using trace markers

Instead of relying on timing-based race detection (which is unreliable), Interlace lets you control exactly when threads execute, making concurrency testing deterministic and reproducible.


Getting Started
---------------

The recommended approach for most use cases is **Trace Markers** - a lightweight, comment-based approach that requires minimal code changes:

.. code-block:: python

   from interlace.trace_markers import Schedule, Step, TraceExecutor

   class Counter:
       def __init__(self):
           self.value = 0

       def increment(self):
           # interlace: after_read
           temp = self.value
           temp += 1
           # interlace: before_write
           self.value = temp

   counter = Counter()
   schedule = Schedule([
       Step("thread1", "after_read"),
       Step("thread2", "after_read"),
       Step("thread1", "before_write"),
       Step("thread2", "before_write"),
   ])

   executor = TraceExecutor(schedule)
   executor.run("thread1", lambda: counter.increment())
   executor.run("thread2", lambda: counter.increment())
   executor.wait(timeout=5.0)

   assert counter.value == 1  # Race condition detected!
