Approaches to Concurrency Control
==================================

Interlace provides two approaches for controlling thread interleaving. This document explains the characteristics, trade-offs, and use cases for each.


Trace Markers (Recommended)
---------------------------

Trace Markers are the recommended approach for most use cases. They use lightweight comment-based markers to define synchronization points in your code.

**Key Advantages:**

- **Lightweight** - Just comments in code, minimal overhead
- **Explicit** - You control exactly where synchronization happens
- **Readable** - Code intent is clear from markers
- **No semantic code changes** - Markers are just comments; logic remains unchanged
- **Two styles** - Use empty line markers for clarity or inline markers for compactness
- **Stable** - Mature and well-tested API

**How It Works:**

.. code-block:: python

   from interlace.trace_markers import Schedule, Step, TraceExecutor

   class Counter:
       def __init__(self):
           self.value = 0

       def increment(self):
           # interlace: after_read
           temp = self.value
           temp += 1
           # interlace: before_write
           self.value = temp

Trace markers are comments that Interlace parses to insert checkpoints. When you run code with a ``TraceExecutor`` and a defined schedule, execution pauses at each marked point to follow the schedule.

**When to Use:**

- You want explicit control over synchronization points
- You're testing code you can modify slightly (adding comments)
- You need a stable, well-understood approach
- You want minimal performance impact
- You're testing for specific race conditions at known points


**Async Support:**

.. warning::

   **WIP**: Async trace marker syntax and semantics are still being finalized.
   See :doc:`future_work` for planned improvements.


Bytecode Instrumentation (Experimental)
----------------------------------------

.. warning::

   Bytecode instrumentation is **experimental** and should be used with caution. The API may change, and behavior is not guaranteed to be stable across Python versions.

Bytecode instrumentation automatically inserts checkpoints into functions using Python bytecode rewriting. No manual marker insertion is needed.

**Key Characteristics:**

- **Experimental** - API may change, use with care
- **Automatic** - No manual checkpoint insertion required
- **Unmodified code** - Can test third-party code without changes
- **Property-based exploration** - Can discover edge cases automatically
- **Higher overhead** - Bytecode instrumentation adds runtime cost

**How It Works:**

.. code-block:: python

   from interlace.bytecode import explore_interleavings

   class Counter:
       def __init__(self, value=0):
           self.value = value

       def increment(self):
           temp = self.value
           self.value = temp + 1

   # Automatically explore different interleavings
   result = explore_interleavings(
       setup=lambda: Counter(value=0),
       threads=[
           lambda c: c.increment(),
           lambda c: c.increment(),
       ],
       invariant=lambda c: c.value == 2,  # Should hold if no races
       max_attempts=200,
       max_ops=200,
       seed=42,
   )

   if not result.property_holds:
       print(f"Race condition found after {result.num_explored} attempts")
       print(f"Expected: 2, Got: {result.counterexample.value}")

**When to Use (with caution):**

- You want to automatically discover race conditions
- You're testing unmodified third-party code
- You're comfortable with experimental features
- You need to explore many possible interleavings
- Performance is not a critical concern

**Controlled Interleaving:**

You can also use explicit schedules with bytecode instrumentation:

.. code-block:: python

   from interlace.bytecode import controlled_interleaving

   counter = Counter(value=0)

   # Sequential schedule: thread 1 completes before thread 2
   schedule = [0] * 200 + [1] * 200
   with controlled_interleaving(schedule, num_threads=2) as runner:
       runner.run([
           lambda: counter.increment(),
           lambda: counter.increment(),
       ])

   print(f"Sequential result: {counter.value}")  # Correct: 2

**Limitations and Caveats:**

- Results may vary across Python versions
- Some bytecode patterns may not be instrumented correctly
- Performance impact is higher than trace markers
- Less predictable behavior than explicit markers
- Async bytecode instrumentation is also experimental

Choosing the Right Approach
---------------------------

**Use Trace Markers if:**

- You want stable, predictable behavior
- You're comfortable adding comments to code
- You have specific synchronization points in mind
- You need deterministic test results
- You're testing code you can modify

**Use Bytecode Instrumentation if:**

- You need to test unmodified third-party code
- You want automatic race condition discovery
- You're comfortable with experimental features
- You have time to handle potential API changes
- Performance is not a concern

**In most cases, start with Trace Markers.** They provide clear, explicit control and stable behavior. Use bytecode instrumentation when you specifically need its capabilities.
