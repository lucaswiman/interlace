SQLAlchemy Lost-Update Race Condition
=====================================

This walkthrough demonstrates frontrun detecting a real race condition
in SQLAlchemy ORM code running against Postgres.  The full source is in
``examples/orm_race.py``.

The bug
-------

Any ORM that computes new column values in Python is vulnerable to
lost updates.  Two concurrent request handlers both read the same row,
compute a new value from what they read, and write it back.  When their
transactions overlap, the second commit silently overwrites the first:

.. code-block:: text

   Handler A:  SELECT → login_count = 0
   Handler B:  SELECT → login_count = 0
   Handler A:  UPDATE SET login_count = 1, COMMIT   ← correct
   Handler B:  UPDATE SET login_count = 1, COMMIT   ← stale! should be 2

The fix is to push the arithmetic into SQL (``SET login_count =
login_count + 1``) or to serialize access with ``SELECT … FOR UPDATE``.

The model and the handler
-------------------------

A minimal SQLAlchemy model and the buggy handler that increments
``login_count`` in Python:

.. code-block:: python

   from sqlalchemy import String, create_engine
   from sqlalchemy.orm import DeclarativeBase, Mapped, Session, mapped_column

   class Base(DeclarativeBase):
       pass

   class User(Base):
       __tablename__ = "users"
       id: Mapped[int] = mapped_column(primary_key=True)
       name: Mapped[str] = mapped_column(String(100))
       login_count: Mapped[int] = mapped_column(default=0)

   engine = create_engine("postgresql:///frontrun_test")

The handler that every demo runs --- one per thread, each with its own
session:

.. code-block:: python

   def handle_login(engine):
       with Session(engine) as session:
           user = session.get(User, 1)          # SELECT
           user.login_count = user.login_count + 1  # Python-side increment
           session.commit()                      # UPDATE … SET login_count=<n>

Two concurrent calls should leave ``login_count == 2``.  The race makes
it ``1``.


Demo 1 --- Trace markers (deterministic)
-----------------------------------------

Trace markers (``# frontrun: orm_read`` / ``# frontrun: orm_write``)
on the ``session.get()`` and ``session.commit()`` lines let
``TraceExecutor`` force both SELECTs to run before either COMMIT:

.. code-block:: python

   from frontrun.common import Schedule, Step
   from frontrun.trace_markers import TraceExecutor

   def handler_a():
       with Session(engine) as session:
           user = session.get(User, 1)            # frontrun: orm_read
           user.login_count = user.login_count + 1
           session.commit()                        # frontrun: orm_write

   schedule = Schedule([
       Step("a", "orm_read"),   # Handler A SELECTs (login_count=0)
       Step("b", "orm_read"),   # Handler B SELECTs (login_count=0, stale)
       Step("a", "orm_write"),  # Handler A COMMITs (login_count=1)
       Step("b", "orm_write"),  # Handler B COMMITs (login_count=1, should be 2!)
   ])

   executor = TraceExecutor(schedule)
   executor.run("a", handler_a)
   executor.run("b", handler_b)
   executor.wait(timeout=10.0)

Output:

.. code-block:: text

   ======================================================================
   Demo 1: SQLAlchemy lost update  (TraceExecutor — deterministic)
   ======================================================================

     Scenario:
       Two handlers each read login_count and increment it in Python.
       Expected final login_count: 2

     Final login_count: 1  (expected 2)

     LOST UPDATE confirmed: one increment was silently lost.
     Handler B's commit wrote login_count=1 based on a stale
     read, overwriting handler A's increment.

     Reproducibility: 100% — the Schedule deterministically forces
     both SELECTs to run before either UPDATE on every execution.


Demo 2 --- Bytecode exploration (automatic)
--------------------------------------------

``explore_interleavings`` generates random opcode-level schedules,
running both handlers against the real database on each attempt.
No trace markers are needed --- the explorer finds the bad interleaving
on its own:

.. code-block:: python

   from frontrun.bytecode import explore_interleavings

   class _State:
       def __init__(self):
           with Session(engine) as session:
               user = session.get(User, 1)
               user.login_count = 0
               session.commit()

   def _thread_fn(_state):
       with Session(engine) as session:
           user = session.get(User, 1)
           user.login_count = user.login_count + 1
           session.commit()

   result = explore_interleavings(
       setup=_State,
       threads=[_thread_fn, _thread_fn],
       invariant=lambda s: _read_count() == 2,
       max_attempts=50,
       seed=42,
       detect_io=False,    # psycopg2 uses C-level sockets
   )

Output:

.. code-block:: text

   ======================================================================
   Demo 2: SQLAlchemy lost update  (bytecode exploration — automatic)
   ======================================================================

     handlers against real Postgres.  Checking whether both
     increments persist after each interleaving.

     property_holds    : False
     attempts_explored : 1
     counterexample found after 1 attempt(s)  (5/5 reproductions)

     Race condition found after 1 interleavings.

       Write-write conflict: threads 0 and 1 both wrote to login_count.

       Thread 0 | orm_race.py:242           user.login_count = user.login_count + 1
                | [read login_count]
       Thread 1 | orm_race.py:242           user.login_count = user.login_count + 1
                | [read+write login_count]
       Thread 0 | orm_race.py:242           user.login_count = user.login_count + 1
                | [write login_count]

       Reproduced 5/5 times (100%)

     LOST UPDATE confirmed via bytecode exploration.

The explorer found the race on its very first attempt and reproduced it
5 out of 5 times.  The trace shows the exact interleaving: both threads
read ``login_count`` (via ``session.get``) before either writes, so
both compute ``0 + 1 = 1``.

Note that while the trace reports a conflict on ``login_count``, this
refers to the *ORM object's Python attribute*, not the database column.
Each thread has its own ``User`` instance (from separate sessions), so
the threads are not actually racing on the same Python object. The real
shared state lives in Postgres. Bytecode exploration finds the bug
anyway because the random schedule happens to interleave the threads in
a way that triggers the database-level race. It doesn't need to
*understand* the conflict to stumble into it.


Demo 3 --- DPOR systematic exploration
---------------------------------------

``explore_dpor`` with ``detect_io=True`` uses the ``LD_PRELOAD`` library
to intercept C-level ``send()``/``recv()`` calls from psycopg2 (which
bypasses Python's socket module).  The intercepted I/O events are routed
through ``IOEventDispatcher`` → ``_PreloadBridge`` → the DPOR engine,
which treats them as conflict points on the shared resource
(``socket:unix:/var/run/postgresql/.s.PGSQL.5432``).

.. code-block:: python

   from frontrun.dpor import explore_dpor

   result = explore_dpor(
       setup=_State,
       threads=[_thread_fn, _thread_fn],
       invariant=lambda s: _read_count() == 2,
       detect_io=True,
       deadlock_timeout=15.0,
   )

Output:

.. code-block:: text

   ======================================================================
   Demo 3: SQLAlchemy lost update  (DPOR — systematic exploration)
   ======================================================================

     DPOR systematically explores all meaningfully different
     interleavings.  C-level I/O is intercepted via LD_PRELOAD.

     property_holds       : False
     num_explored         : 2

     LOST UPDATE confirmed via DPOR.

     Race condition found after 2 interleavings.

       Write-write conflict: threads 0 and 1 both wrote to login_count.

       Thread 0 | send/recv socket:unix:/var/run/postgresql/.s.PGSQL.5432
       Thread 1 | send/recv socket:unix:/var/run/postgresql/.s.PGSQL.5432
       Thread 1 | orm_race.py:323       user.login_count = user.login_count + 1
                | [read+write User.login_count]
       Thread 1 | send/recv socket:unix:/var/run/postgresql/.s.PGSQL.5432
       Thread 0 | orm_race.py:323       user.login_count = user.login_count + 1
                | [read+write User.login_count]
       Thread 0 | send/recv socket:unix:/var/run/postgresql/.s.PGSQL.5432

       Reproduced 10/10 times (100%)

DPOR detected the lost update in just 2 interleavings.  The trace
interleaves C-level socket I/O (libpq ``send``/``recv``) with
Python-level attribute accesses, telling the full story:

1. Thread 0 sends a ``SELECT`` to Postgres and receives the result
   (``login_count = 0``).
2. Thread 1 sends its own ``SELECT`` and receives ``login_count = 0``
   (Thread 0 hasn't committed yet).
3. Thread 1 computes ``0 + 1 = 1`` in Python (``user.login_count =
   user.login_count + 1``).
4. Thread 1 sends ``UPDATE … SET login_count = 1`` and ``COMMIT``.
5. Thread 0 computes ``0 + 1 = 1`` in Python from its stale read.
6. Thread 0 sends ``UPDATE … SET login_count = 1`` and ``COMMIT``,
   silently overwriting Thread 1's increment.

The I/O events (``send/recv socket:…``) come from the ``LD_PRELOAD``
library intercepting libpq's C-level socket calls.  DPOR uses these as
conflict points to explore alternative thread orderings around database
operations --- even though psycopg2 never goes through Python's
``socket`` module.

Each thread creates its own ``Session`` and gets its own ``User`` ORM
instance, so there is no Python-level shared state.  The real conflict
is the database row, and DPOR finds it via the network I/O.

.. note::

   **Indexical INSERT IDs.**  Frontrun automatically captures
   ``cursor.lastrowid`` after INSERTs and uses stable logical aliases
   (like ``sql:users:t0_ins0``) for DPOR conflict detection, so
   autoincrement IDs don't cause nondeterminism.  If ``lastrowid``
   capture fails (e.g. psycopg2 without ``RETURNING``),
   ``NondeterministicSQLError`` is raised by default.  See
   :doc:`sql-technical-details` for details.


Demo 4 --- Naive threading (intermittent)
------------------------------------------

Plain threads against real Postgres, with a random 0--15 ms start offset
modelling realistic request-arrival timing.  The race reproduces only a
fraction of the time --- exactly the kind of flaky bug that slips through
CI:

.. code-block:: text

   ======================================================================
   Demo 4: Naive threading + SQLAlchemy  (500 trials)
   ======================================================================

     Running both handlers in plain threads against real Postgres.
     Threads start with a random 0-15ms offset to model realistic
     request arrival timing.  Counting how often the race manifests...

     Trials:   500
     Failures: 62
     Rate:     12.4%

     The race manifested in 62/500 trials (12.4%).
     frontrun makes it 100% reproducible.

With ordinary threads the bug surfaces roughly 10--15% of the time
(the exact rate varies with system load).  Trace markers, bytecode
exploration, and DPOR all catch it deterministically, every time.
