Quick Start
===========

This guide covers the basics using **trace markers** --- the simplest approach.
For automatic race finding without manual markers, see :doc:`dpor_guide` (systematic
exploration) or :doc:`approaches` (bytecode exploration).


Triggering a Race Condition
----------------------------

.. code-block:: python

   from frontrun.common import Schedule, Step
   from frontrun.trace_markers import TraceExecutor

   class Counter:
       def __init__(self):
           self.value = 0

       def increment(self):
           temp = self.value  # frontrun: read_value
           temp += 1
           self.value = temp  # frontrun: write_value

   def test_counter_lost_update():
       counter = Counter()

       # Both threads read before either writes, causing a lost update
       schedule = Schedule([
           Step("thread1", "read_value"),    # T1 reads 0
           Step("thread2", "read_value"),    # T2 reads 0 (both see same value!)
           Step("thread1", "write_value"),   # T1 writes 1
           Step("thread2", "write_value"),   # T2 writes 1 (overwrites T1's update!)
       ])

       executor = TraceExecutor(schedule)
       executor.run({
           "thread1": counter.increment,
           "thread2": counter.increment,
       }, timeout=5.0)

       assert counter.value == 1  # One increment lost


How Trace Markers Work
-----------------------

Trace markers are comments of the form ``# frontrun: <name>`` that tell
Frontrun where synchronization points are. A marker **gates** the code that
follows it: when a thread reaches a marker, it pauses until the scheduler grants
it a turn. Only then does the gated code execute.

Under the hood, each thread runs with a ``sys.settrace`` callback that fires
on every source line. The callback checks whether the line contains a
``# frontrun:`` comment (via a ``MarkerRegistry`` that caches marker locations
per file). When a marker is hit, the thread blocks on a ``threading.Condition``
until the scheduler advances to that step.

Two placement styles are supported:

1. **Inline with code** (marker on the same line as the operation it gates):

   .. code-block:: python

       def increment(self):
           temp = self.value  # frontrun: read_value
           temp += 1
           self.value = temp  # frontrun: write_value

   Here ``read_value`` gates the read of ``self.value``, and ``write_value``
   gates the write.

2. **On a separate line** before the operation:

   .. code-block:: python

       def increment(self):
           # frontrun: read_value
           temp = self.value
           temp += 1
           # frontrun: write_value
           self.value = temp

   The semantics are the same: the marker gates the next executable line.

Name markers after the operation they gate (``read_value``, ``write_balance``,
``acquire_lock``, etc.) rather than using temporal prefixes like ``before_`` or
``after_``.


Creating Schedules
-------------------

A schedule defines the execution order of marked synchronization points:

.. code-block:: python

   from frontrun.common import Schedule, Step

   schedule = Schedule([
       Step("thread1", "marker_name_1"),
       Step("thread1", "marker_name_2"),
       Step("thread2", "marker_name_1"),
       Step("thread2", "marker_name_2"),
   ])

Each ``Step`` specifies the thread/task name and the marker name to execute at
that step.


Running with Controlled Interleaving
-------------------------------------

Pass a ``{name: callable}`` dict to ``run()`` to start all threads and wait for
them in a single call:

.. code-block:: python

   from frontrun.trace_markers import TraceExecutor

   executor = TraceExecutor(schedule)
   executor.run({
       "thread1": task_function_1,
       "thread2": task_function_2,
   }, timeout=5.0)

This is the preferred form and matches the async API exactly.

.. note::

   **Legacy API (deprecated)**

   The original two-step form is still supported but emits a
   ``DeprecationWarning`` and will be removed in version 0.6::

       executor.run("thread1", task_function_1)   # deprecated
       executor.run("thread2", task_function_2)   # deprecated
       executor.wait(timeout=5.0)


Async Support
-------------

Async trace markers use the same comment-based syntax. Each async task runs in
its own thread (via ``asyncio.run``), with ``sys.settrace`` controlling
interleaving between tasks.

A marker gates the next ``await`` expression. When a task reaches a marker, it
pauses until the scheduler grants it a turn; only then does the gated ``await``
execute. Between two markers the task runs without interruption from other
scheduled tasks.

.. code-block:: python

   from frontrun import TraceExecutor
   from frontrun.common import Schedule, Step

   class AsyncCounter:
       def __init__(self):
           self.value = 0

       async def get_value(self):
           return self.value

       async def set_value(self, new_value):
           self.value = new_value

       async def increment(self):
           # frontrun: read_value
           temp = await self.get_value()
           # frontrun: write_value
           await self.set_value(temp + 1)

   def test_async_counter_lost_update():
       counter = AsyncCounter()

       # Both tasks read before either writes --- triggers the lost update
       schedule = Schedule([
           Step("task1", "read_value"),
           Step("task2", "read_value"),
           Step("task1", "write_value"),
           Step("task2", "write_value"),
       ])

       executor = TraceExecutor(schedule)
       executor.run({
           "task1": counter.increment,
           "task2": counter.increment,
       })

       # Both tasks read 0, then both write 1 --- one increment is lost
       assert counter.value == 1

   def test_async_counter_serialized():
       counter = AsyncCounter()

       # Serialized: task1 completes before task2 starts
       schedule = Schedule([
           Step("task1", "read_value"),
           Step("task1", "write_value"),
           Step("task2", "read_value"),
           Step("task2", "write_value"),
       ])

       executor = TraceExecutor(schedule)
       executor.run({
           "task1": counter.increment,
           "task2": counter.increment,
       })

       assert counter.value == 2  # No lost update

Prefer ``assert_holds()`` over manual asserts
----------------------------------------------

Instead of writing ``assert result.property_holds, result.explanation`` after
every exploration call, use the convenience helper :meth:`InterleavingResult.assert_holds`::

   result = explore_dpor(setup, [thread1, thread2], invariant)
   result.assert_holds()  # raises AssertionError with explanation on failure

An optional ``msg_prefix`` is prepended to the explanation, which is handy
when multiple assertions appear in one test::

   result.assert_holds(msg_prefix="counter race: ")
