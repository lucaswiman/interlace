# Frontrun: Developer Marketing & Adoption Strategy

*Written March 2026. Assumes 0.4.0 is stable and feature-complete.*

## Why this can work

Frontrun has three things that most new open-source projects don't:

1. **A real problem with no real competition.** Python has no equivalent of Go's race detector, Java's jcstress, or Rust's Miri for concurrency testing. The closest things are `pytest-race` (just runs your test in N threads and hopes for the best) and manual `time.sleep()` hacks. Frontrun is categorically different: deterministic scheduling at the bytecode level.

2. **A proof-of-concept that already works.** 46 bugs found across 12 real libraries — urllib3, SQLAlchemy, cachetools, etc. — against *unmodified* library code. That's not a toy demo; it's a repeatable result that any developer can verify.

3. **Perfect timing.** Python 3.14 makes free-threading officially supported (no longer experimental). The GIL protected Python developers from the worst concurrency bugs for 30 years. That protection is going away. Every library maintainer, every team running threaded Python code, is about to need tools like this.

The free-threading angle is your single biggest tailwind. Lean into it hard.

---

## Phase 1: Foundation (weeks 1-4)

Get the basics right before telling anyone about the project.

### Polish the README

The current README is solid technically but reads like reference docs. For adoption, you need a "why should I care" section *above* the API details. Structure:

1. **One-sentence pitch** — "Deterministic concurrency testing for Python. Find race conditions that only happen 1 in 1000 times, and reproduce them every time."
2. **The problem** — 2-3 sentences on why race conditions are hard to test. Mention the free-threading shift.
3. **The proof** — "46 bugs found in 12 libraries including urllib3 and SQLAlchemy" with a link to case studies. This is your best marketing asset.
4. **Quickstart** — the bank account example (already good).
5. **The four approaches** — keep this but make it scannable.
6. **Installation** — `pip install frontrun`.

### Create a landing page or microsite

Even a single-page site at a custom domain (e.g. `frontrun.dev` or similar) helps. GitHub repos feel like "someone's project"; a landing page feels like "a tool I should evaluate." You can use GitHub Pages. Keep it minimal — the README content reformatted with better typography, plus the deadlock diagram.

### Record a 2-minute demo video

Screen-record a terminal session:
- Start with a racy bank account class (no synchronization)
- Run `explore_interleavings` — show it finding the bug in seconds
- Run `explore_dpor` — show the richer output with conflict analysis
- Show the fix (add a lock), re-run, all interleavings pass

Host on YouTube. Embed in the README and landing page. Developers trust demos more than docs.

### Write "Getting Started" docs

The current docs are comprehensive but assume familiarity. Write a dedicated getting-started guide that takes someone from `pip install frontrun` to their first caught bug in under 5 minutes. Optimize for copy-paste-ability.

---

## Phase 2: Launch (weeks 4-6)

### Write the launch blog post

This is your most important piece of content. It should *not* be a feature tour. It should be a story. Suggested structure:

**Title:** "Python's GIL Is Going Away. Here's How to Find the Concurrency Bugs It Was Hiding."

Or more directly: "I Found 46 Concurrency Bugs in urllib3, SQLAlchemy, and 10 Other Python Libraries"

**Structure:**
1. **The hook** — Python 3.14 makes free-threading official. The GIL isn't protecting you anymore. What does that mean?
2. **The problem** — Show a simple race condition. Show how `time.sleep()`-based testing is fundamentally broken. Show a test that "passes" 95% of the time.
3. **The approach** — Explain deterministic scheduling in intuitive terms: "instead of hoping threads collide, we *make* them collide."
4. **The results** — Walk through 2-3 of your best case studies. urllib3's connection pool counter is great because everyone uses urllib3. The SQLAlchemy one is interesting because it's racy but benign — shows the tool finds real things and helps you reason about severity.
5. **Try it yourself** — `pip install frontrun`, 10-line example, link to docs.

Write it in your own voice. Post on your personal blog. *Then* submit to Hacker News and share on Reddit.

### Hacker News launch

Submit as **"Show HN: Frontrun — deterministic concurrency testing for Python (found 46 bugs in 12 libraries)"**

Key advice from people who've done this well:
- **Link to the GitHub repo**, not a landing page. HN readers want to see code.
- **Write a top comment** explaining the motivation, what makes it different from pytest-race / sleep-based approaches, and the free-threading angle.
- **Post on a Tuesday or Wednesday morning** (US time). Monday works too. Avoid Friday.
- **Be present in the comments.** Answer every question. Be candid about limitations (e.g., DPOR can't see pure C-level mutations without LD_PRELOAD). Humility plays well on HN; marketing language does not.
- **Don't ask friends to upvote.** HN detects and penalizes vote rings. *Do* tell friends to check it out — genuine engagement is fine.

A strong HN launch can get you 5,000-15,000 visitors and 200-500 GitHub stars in a day. More importantly, it puts you on the radar of the people who write Python's core infrastructure.

### Reddit

Post to these subreddits (stagger by a day or two, don't spam):
- **r/Python** — largest Python community. Post the blog post. Title should match the HN framing.
- **r/programming** — broader audience, good for the "46 bugs" angle.
- **r/ExperiencedDevs** — if you frame it as "here's how I found concurrency bugs in production libraries."

Same rules as HN: be present, answer questions, don't be salesy.

### Python newsletters and aggregators

Reach out (or submit) to:
- **Python Weekly** — curated newsletter, widely read. They accept submissions.
- **PyCoder's Weekly** — same.
- **This Week in Python** / **Awesome Python** — community-maintained lists.
- **dev.to** — cross-post your blog post there (they allow canonical URLs so it doesn't hurt your blog's SEO).

---

## Phase 3: Community & Content (ongoing)

### Conference talks

PyCon US 2026 (Long Beach, May) — the CFP already closed (December 2025), so you missed this round. But:

- **PyCon US 2027** — submit when the CFP opens (likely fall 2026). A talk on "Deterministic Concurrency Testing" or "Finding Race Conditions the GIL Was Hiding" would be a strong fit, especially given the free-threading track interest.
- **PyBay 2026** (SF, August) — regional conference run by SF Python. ~750 attendees. Watch for their CFP.
- **PyCascades 2026** — PNW regional conference, watch for their CFP.
- **PyCon Italia**, **EuroPython**, **PyConDE** — if you want international reach.
- **Strange Loop** / **!!Con** / **CUFP** — if you want to reach the PL/formal methods crowd who'd appreciate the DPOR angle.

Conference talks are high-effort but high-leverage. One good PyCon talk gets watched on YouTube by 10,000+ people over the next few years.

### SF Bay Area meetups (your backyard advantage)

You live in the Bay Area. Use it.

- **SF Python** (sfpythonmeetup.com) — 17,000+ members. Two monthly meetups:
  - *Presentation Night* (2nd Wednesday) — intermediate-to-advanced tech talks. **This is your target.** Propose a 20-30 minute talk on frontrun. They feature core devs and OSS maintainers regularly.
  - *Project Night* (3rd Wednesday) — more informal, good for demoing and getting feedback.
- **PyLadies SF** — weekly study groups, could do a lightning talk or workshop.
- **Bay Area Software Engineers (BASE)** — broader audience, good for the "why concurrency testing matters" framing.

A local meetup talk is low-stakes practice for a conference talk. You get direct feedback, you meet potential users, and the SF Python community is well-connected to the broader Python ecosystem.

### Write follow-up content

Don't do one launch post and go silent. Plan 3-5 posts over the next few months:

1. **"How `explore_interleavings` Works Under the Hood"** — the `sys.settrace` + `f_trace_opcodes` mechanism is genuinely interesting. PL/compilers nerds will love this.
2. **"Testing Async Race Conditions in FastAPI"** — practical tutorial. FastAPI is the hot framework; tie frontrun to something people are already using.
3. **"What I Learned from 46 Concurrency Bugs"** — synthesize the case studies into patterns. "5 categories of race condition in Python library code." This is linkbait in the best sense — genuinely useful.
4. **"DPOR for Python: How We Ported a Formal Methods Technique to Dynamic Languages"** — targets the academic/PL audience. Could also be a workshop paper.
5. **"Concurrency Testing for the No-GIL Era"** — update when Python 3.14 ships or when free-threading adoption picks up. Evergreen angle.

### Contribute bug reports upstream

You've found 46 bugs. File issues (or PRs) against the affected libraries. This does three things:
- It's the right thing to do.
- It creates backlinks to frontrun from high-traffic repos (urllib3 has 3.7k stars, SQLAlchemy has 9k, cachetools has 2k).
- It demonstrates the tool's value to library maintainers, who are your highest-leverage early adopters.

Be respectful in how you file these. Lead with "I found this using a concurrency testing tool" and include a minimal reproducer. Don't spam 46 issues at once — pick the 5-10 most impactful bugs and file those first.

---

## Phase 4: Ecosystem Integration (months 3-6)

### pytest plugin

You already have a pytest plugin. Make sure it's discoverable:
- Register it on the [pytest plugin list](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/reference/plugin_list.html) if not already.
- Write a short guide: "Adding Concurrency Tests to Your Existing pytest Suite."

### CI integration guide

Write a doc showing how to add frontrun to GitHub Actions / CI. Something like:

```yaml
- name: Concurrency tests
  run: pip install frontrun && frontrun pytest tests/concurrency/
```

Making it easy to add to CI lowers the barrier from "interesting tool" to "part of our workflow."

### Integrations with popular libraries

The Redis and SQL cursor interception is a big differentiator. Write targeted guides:
- "Testing Race Conditions in Your Redis Cache Layer"
- "Finding Connection Pool Races in SQLAlchemy"
- "Concurrency Testing for Django/FastAPI Backends"

Each of these targets a specific community and gives you a reason to post in their forums/subreddits.

---

## Messaging: what to emphasize

### Lead with the problem, not the tool

Bad: "Frontrun is a deterministic concurrency testing library with four approaches..."
Good: "Your concurrent Python code has race conditions. Here's how to find them."

### The "46 bugs" number is your headline

It's specific, credible, and impressive. Use it everywhere: README, blog post, HN title, conference abstract. "46 concurrency bugs found in 12 libraries" is more compelling than any feature description.

### The free-threading angle is your news hook

"Python is removing the GIL" is a story that every Python developer is paying attention to. Position frontrun as the answer to "what do I do about concurrency now?"

### Don't oversell

Be honest about limitations:
- DPOR can't see mutations inside C extensions without LD_PRELOAD
- Bytecode schedules are CPython-version-specific
- The tool finds races; whether they matter requires human judgment (the SQLAlchemy example proves this)

Honesty builds trust with developers faster than perfection claims.

## Metrics to watch

Don't obsess over vanity metrics, but track these to know if your efforts are working:

| Metric | Signal |
|--------|--------|
| GitHub stars | Awareness — are people hearing about frontrun? |
| PyPI downloads | Adoption — are people actually trying it? |
| Issues filed by non-you | Engagement — are people using it enough to hit edges? |
| PRs from external contributors | Community — is this becoming more than a solo project? |
| Conference/meetup talk invitations | Reputation — is the Python community recognizing this? |
| Mentions in other projects' issues | Impact — is frontrun becoming a known tool? |

A healthy trajectory for a niche-but-useful tool: ~500 stars and ~1,000 monthly PyPI downloads within 6 months of launch would be strong. The free-threading wave could push it higher.

---

## Budget: $0 (mostly)

Almost everything here is free. The only costs worth considering:

- **Domain name** for a landing page (~$12/year)
- **Travel to conferences** (PyCon offers speaker travel grants; PyBay is local)
- **Your time** — this is the real cost. The writing and community engagement adds up. Budget roughly 5-8 hours/week for the first 2-3 months, then taper as content compounds.

---

## Summary: the first 30 days

| Week | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Polish README (problem/proof/quickstart structure). Record demo video. |
| 2 | Write the launch blog post. Set up landing page. |
| 3 | File 5-10 upstream bug reports against affected libraries. |
| 4 | **Launch day:** Submit to HN (Show HN). Same day: r/Python. Next day: r/programming. Submit to Python Weekly / PyCoder's Weekly. |
| 4+ | Be present in comments for 3-5 days. Cross-post blog to dev.to. Propose an SF Python Presentation Night talk. |

Then shift to Phase 3 (ongoing content + conference talks) and Phase 4 (ecosystem integration).
