# Interlace

A library for deterministic concurrency testing that helps you reliably reproduce and test race conditions.

## Overview

Interlace provides tools for controlling thread interleaving at a fine-grained level, allowing you to:

- **Deterministically reproduce race conditions** - Force specific interleavings to make race conditions happen reliably in tests
- **Test concurrent code exhaustively** - Explore different execution orders to find bugs
- **Verify synchronization correctness** - Ensure that proper locking prevents race conditions

Instead of relying on timing-based race detection (which is unreliable), Interlace lets you control exactly when threads execute, making concurrency testing deterministic and reproducible.

## Quick Start: Bank Account Race Condition

Here's a simple example showing how to use Interlace to detect a race condition using trace markers:

```python
from interlace.trace_markers import Schedule, Step, TraceExecutor

class BankAccount:
    def __init__(self, balance=0):
        self.balance = balance

    def transfer(self, amount):
        # This method has a race condition: read-modify-write without synchronization
        # interlace: after_read
        current = self.balance  # READ
        new_balance = current + amount  # COMPUTE
        # interlace: before_write
        self.balance = new_balance  # WRITE

# Demonstrate the race condition
account = BankAccount(balance=100)

# Define an interleaving that triggers the race:
# Both threads read before either writes
schedule = Schedule([
    Step("thread1", "after_read"),    # T1 reads 100
    Step("thread2", "after_read"),    # T2 reads 100 (both see same value!)
    Step("thread1", "before_write"),  # T1 writes 150
    Step("thread2", "before_write"),  # T2 writes 150 (overwrites T1's update!)
])

executor = TraceExecutor(schedule)
executor.run("thread1", lambda: account.transfer(50))
executor.run("thread2", lambda: account.transfer(50))
executor.wait(timeout=5.0)

# Result: balance is 150, not 200 - one update was lost!
assert account.balance == 150, "Race condition detected!"
```

## Real-World Case Studies

See how Interlace finds concurrency bugs in real-world libraries:

**[Interlace Case Studies](docs/CASE_STUDIES.rst)** — Five detailed case studies demonstrating how Interlace discovers and reproduces race conditions in unmodified production code:

- **TPool**: TOCTOU race in thread pool shutdown (20/20 seeds, 1-3 attempts)
- **threadpoolctl**: TOCTOU in libc initialization (20/20 seeds, **1 attempt average**)
- **cachetools**: Lost update in cache size tracking (20/20 seeds, 4 attempts)
- **PyDispatcher**: Lost signal registrations (20/20 seeds, 1.3 attempts)
- **pydis**: Lost Redis operations (20/20 seeds, 1.25 attempts)

## Usage Approaches

Interlace provides two different ways to control thread interleaving:

### 1. Trace Markers

Use comment-based markers for reproducing known race conditions or investigating whether a particular race condition is possible. Markers can be placed inline with code or on empty lines.

**How it works:** Each thread is run with a [`sys.settrace`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.settrace) callback that fires on every source line. The callback scans each line for `# interlace: <name>` comments. When a marker is hit, the thread pauses and waits for a `ThreadCoordinator` to grant it the next turn according to the schedule. This gives you deterministic control over the order threads reach each synchronization point, without changing any executable code — markers are just comments.

```python
from interlace.trace_markers import Schedule, Step, TraceExecutor

class Counter:
    def __init__(self):
        self.value = 0

    def increment(self):
        # Markers on empty lines (cleaner):
        # interlace: after_read
        temp = self.value
        temp += 1
        # interlace: before_write
        self.value = temp

        # Or use inline markers:
        # temp = self.value  # interlace: after_read
        # self.value = temp  # interlace: before_write

counter = Counter()

# Define execution order using markers
schedule = Schedule([
    Step("thread1", "after_read"),
    Step("thread2", "after_read"),
    Step("thread1", "before_write"),
    Step("thread2", "before_write"),
])

def worker1():
    counter.increment()

def worker2():
    counter.increment()

# Run with controlled interleaving
executor = TraceExecutor(schedule)
executor.run("thread1", worker1)
executor.run("thread2", worker2)
executor.wait(timeout=5.0)

assert counter.value == 1  # Race condition!
```

**Advantages:**
- Lightweight - just comments in code
- Two placement styles: empty lines (cleaner) or inline (compact)
- Automatic execution tracing
- Simple and readable
- No semantic code changes required
- Stable and well-tested

### 2. Bytecode Manipulation (Experimental)

> ⚠️ **Warning:** Bytecode instrumentation is **experimental**. It requires monkey-patching basic concurrency primitives during test execution and relies on `f_trace_opcodes` (available since Python 3.7). Use with caution.

Automatically instrument functions using bytecode rewriting. No checkpoints needed!

**How it works:** Each thread is run with a [`sys.settrace`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.settrace) callback that sets `f_trace_opcodes = True` on every frame, so the callback fires at every *bytecode instruction* rather than every source line. At each opcode, the thread calls `scheduler.wait_for_turn()` which blocks until the schedule says it's that thread's turn. This gives complete control over interleaving at the finest granularity CPython offers.

Because the scheduler controls which thread runs each opcode, any blocking call that happens in C code (like `threading.Lock.acquire()`) would deadlock — the blocked thread holds a scheduler turn but can't make progress. To prevent this, all standard threading and queue primitives (`Lock`, `RLock`, `Semaphore`, `BoundedSemaphore`, `Event`, `Condition`, `Queue`, `LifoQueue`, `PriorityQueue`) are monkey-patched with cooperative versions that spin-yield via the scheduler instead of blocking.

For property-based exploration, `explore_interleavings()` generates random schedules and checks that an invariant holds under each one. If any schedule violates the invariant, it returns the counterexample schedule for deterministic reproduction.

```python
from interlace.bytecode import explore_interleavings

class Counter:
    def __init__(self, value=0):
        self.value = value

    def increment(self):
        temp = self.value
        self.value = temp + 1

# Use explore_interleavings to find race conditions
result = explore_interleavings(
    setup=lambda: Counter(value=0),
    threads=[
        lambda c: c.increment(),
        lambda c: c.increment(),
    ],
    invariant=lambda c: c.value == 2,  # This should hold if no races exist
    max_attempts=200,
    max_ops=200,
    seed=42,
)

if not result.property_holds:
    print("Race condition found!")
    print(f"After {result.num_explored} attempts")
    print(f"Expected value: 2, Got: {result.counterexample.value}")
```

Or use controlled interleaving with explicit schedules:

```python
from interlace.bytecode import controlled_interleaving, OpcodeScheduler, BytecodeInterlace

counter = Counter(value=0)

def thread1():
    counter.increment()

def thread2():
    counter.increment()

# Sequential schedule: thread 1 completes before thread 2 starts
schedule = [0] * 200 + [1] * 200
with controlled_interleaving(schedule, num_threads=2) as runner:
    runner.run([thread1, thread2])

print(f"Sequential result: {counter.value}")  # Correct: 2

# Interleaved schedule: rapidly alternate between threads
counter2 = Counter(value=0)
schedule = [0, 1] * 150  # Alternate rapidly
with controlled_interleaving(schedule, num_threads=2) as runner:
    runner.run([
        lambda: counter2.increment(),
        lambda: counter2.increment(),
    ])

print(f"Interleaved result: {counter2.value}")  # Might be wrong due to race
```

**Advantages (Experimental):**
- No manual checkpoint insertion needed
- Can test unmodified third-party code
- Property-based exploration finds edge cases
- Automatic bytecode instrumentation

**Limitations:**
- Results may vary across Python versions
- Some bytecode patterns may not be instrumented correctly
- Performance impact is higher than trace markers
- Less predictable behavior than explicit markers
- **API may change in future versions**

### When to Use Each Approach

**Use Trace Markers (recommended) if:**
- You want stable, predictable behavior
- You're comfortable adding comments to code
- You have specific synchronization points in mind
- You need deterministic test results
- You're testing code you can modify

**Use Bytecode Instrumentation (with caution) if:**
- You need to test unmodified third-party code
- You want automatic race condition discovery
- You're comfortable with experimental features
- You have time to handle potential API changes

## Async Support

Both approaches have async variants. Trace marker async support is stable, while bytecode instrumentation async support is experimental (see above).

### Async Trace Markers (Recommended)

```python
import asyncio
from interlace.async_trace_markers import AsyncTraceExecutor
from interlace.common import Schedule, Step

class Counter:
    def __init__(self):
        self.value = 0

    async def increment(self):
        # interlace: after_read
        temp = self.value
        await asyncio.sleep(0)  # Yield point for marker
        # interlace: before_write
        await asyncio.sleep(0)  # Yield point for marker
        self.value = temp + 1

counter = Counter()

# Define execution order using markers
schedule = Schedule([
    Step("task1", "after_read"),
    Step("task2", "after_read"),
    Step("task1", "before_write"),
    Step("task2", "before_write"),
])

# Run with controlled interleaving (synchronous method)
executor = AsyncTraceExecutor(schedule)
executor.run({
    "task1": counter.increment,
    "task2": counter.increment,
})

assert counter.value == 1  # Race condition!
```

**Key insight:** In async code, race conditions only happen at `await` points since the event loop is single-threaded. Marker placement is crucial for proper synchronization.
