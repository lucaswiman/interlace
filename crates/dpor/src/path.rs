//! Exploration tree for Source Sets DPOR.
//!
//! Implements a hybrid of Algorithms 1 and 2 from Abdulla et al., "Source Sets:
//! A Foundation for Optimal Dynamic Partial Order Reduction", JACM 2017.
//!
//! **Current algorithm**: Uses wakeup trees (Algorithm 2, JACM'17 p.24-25) as
//! the exploration structure, with race detection during execution (Algorithm 1
//! style, JACM'17 p.16) as well as deferred notdep processing (Algorithm 2).
//! Sleep sets are propagated across scheduling points using trace caching.
//! Source set filtering is disabled (all racing threads are inserted into
//! wakeup trees).
//!
//! Each scheduling point (Branch) maintains:
//!
//! - A **wakeup tree** of thread sequences to explore — replaces classic
//!   Backtrack status with ordered, structured exploration.
//!   (Algorithm 2 lines 14-20, JACM'17 p.24-25)
//! - A **sleep set** of threads that should not be re-explored because an
//!   equivalent execution has already been covered.
//!   (Algorithm 2 lines 13, 20, JACM'17 p.24-25)
//! - **Object tracking** per thread to enable independence-based sleep set
//!   propagation across scheduling points (needed for Algorithm 2 line 16:
//!   `Sleep' = {q ∈ sleep(E) | E ⊢ p♦q}`).
